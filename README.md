[Calculator ](https://github.com/tpoulos/Calculator)
===========================================
_An HTML5 calculator just like the one on your desk_


Background
----------
I created this calculator to practice working with web-technologies, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Unlike most calculator apps, which create a string of mathematical operations and evaluate the string, I decided that I would make a calculator that worked
exactly like a real pocket calculator, complete with an 8 character display and no order of operation support. There are some fundamental issues with this (for instance floating point arithmetic,) however I have still attempted to stick to the project as closely as possible.
